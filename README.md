### Problem Statement

The decision maker has selected five tools as appropriate for his business. However instead of applying all the five tools simultaneously , the priority of tools has to be established. Three criteria are found to be important for the decision maker. The five tools have conflicting objectives with respect to the three criteria.

#### Problem solving steps

1. open the link as instructed above as in - thesis.cleverapps.io/ahp3 , here we are using "ahp3" because we have 3 criteria.
2. now enter the data as given in the book -

5. click on submit button , download values and hit reload, since these values were for 1st criteria , we have to still do pairwise comparison 
for remaining 2 criteria. so hit reload and calculate for other 2 criteria.

6. after doing this , head on to ahp page and click result and click on "enter data" as instructed before

7. The data after entered will look like below -

3. Follow the order in which buttons are given

### Problem statement

A panel of three experts (shown as E1, E2, E3) rated the criteria and the alternatives under each criterion. The experts were asked to rate the criteria on a linguistic variable having five values as shown in Table. 
This table also shows the importance weight in fuzzy terms and crisp values based on graded mean representation. Also the experts were asked to rate the alternatives on a linguistic variable having five values as shown in next Table. This table also shows the importance weight in fuzzy terms and crisp values based on graded mean representation.

1. click the wt.of criteria button and enter data as given below -
